# Network Automation chapter — Paramiko · Netmiko · Ansible · NAPALM · Telnet
# Drop this dict into the CHAPTERS list in app/content.py (see header there).
# Matches your existing chapter/lesson structure exactly.
#
# Design note on the "Real Driver" sections: the production-grade code shown
# there is the genuine library code (real imports, real device IPs) — it
# needs `pip install <library>` plus an actual reachable device, so clicking
# "Run in Editor" on it will fail in this sandbox (ModuleNotFoundError, a
# connection error, or a timeout). That failure is expected and is called
# out in each section's `note`. The "Practice Safely" section right after it
# and the lesson's exercise use a small in-script simulated device instead,
# so the exact same class shape (connect → send_command → close) actually
# runs end to end with zero new dependencies and zero real network access.
